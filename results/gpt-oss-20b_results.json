She is accompanied by her mother today.\n\nKayla states her acne started approximately 2 years ago and it is present almost every day. The patient\u2019s mother notes that the most significant acne flares started in the fall when she was playing school sports. It does not tend to flare with her periods. Kayla reports that today is a good day for her acne. She denies any significant acne present on the chest or back. There are no associated symptoms, including no itching, bleeding, or pain.\n\nThe patient has been washing her face regularly. Her acne regimen includes washing her face in the morning with Persa-Gel and at night e.l.f. SuperClarify Cleanser along with toner and Persa-Gel. This regimen is somewhat helpful. She wears sunscreen in the summer SPF 30.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nLives with parents and sister. They have a dog, bird, and rabbits in the home.

I recommend starting with topical therapy first. The patient was instructed to wash face every morning with a mild cleanser, then use a non-comedogenic moisturizer with sunscreen SPF 30 of higher. In the evening, wash face with same mild cleanser and allow to dry. Apply a thin layer of topical retinoid, Retin-A 0.1% gel, to acne prone areas. Start off using a few nights a week, slowly work up to using every night. If it is very expensive or not covered by insurance, you can try Differin gel over the counter. Your topical retinoid will cause sun sensitivity, so you will need to wear sunscreen when you are outside. It may also cause some dryness or irritation.\n\nMultiple benign melanocytic nevi of upper and lower extremities and trunk.\nReassurance given moles are normal in appearance and have no concerning characteristics. Will continue to monitor for progression or changes in 6 months.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow recommended cleaning regimen.\nStart Retin-A 0.1% topical gel, apply to acne prone areas, titrate as instructed.\nFollow up in 6 months.\n",

      "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nHeart murmur.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a 100-year-old female who presents today for evaluation of a heart murmur.\n\nMs. Scott has been recently diagnosed with a \u201cnew, worrisome\u201d heart murmur. She denies chest pain, syncope, palpitations, fevers, or chills. She reports shortness of breath if she walks too fast, too long, or tries to drink a whole glass of water without stopping. The patient requires a walker and can walk around her cul-de-sac or to the end of the driveway without shortness of breath. Compared to 6 months ago, her functioning has declined 20-30%. Prior to 6 months, symptoms were absent. For the past month she has been experiencing severe, bilateral leg pain, which was limiting her mobility. She did see her doctor last week who completed a chest x-ray and prescribed pain medicine. Occasionally, she feels dizzy but takes medication for this and it subsides. Her ankles have been swelling for the past 6 months, but the swelling fluctuates day to day. Her weight has been slowly decreasing over the past year, with her current weight at 120 pounds, previous weight was 130 pounds. She also reports feeling \u201coverly tired\u201d but attributes this to her polypharmacy.\n\nThe patient is unsure if she has completed any cardiovascular testing.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nHyperlipidemia.\nHypertension.\nHypothyroid.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nRequires a walker to ambulate.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nSon had a myocardial infarction.\nBrother had a stroke and has diabetes.\nOlder sister has an unknown heart problem.\nFamily is positive for heart disease.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\n\nLevothyroxine.\nLisinopril.\nSimvastatin 20 mg.\nMeclizine.\nAmlodipine.\n\nALLERGIES\n\nNo known drug allergies.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nConstitutional\nElderly, no acute distress.\n\nCardiovascular\nNormal S1, S2 preserved, irregular rhythm and normal rate. 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids.\n\nMusculoskeletal\nLower extremity edema\n\nNeurologic\nGait normal for age.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEKG\nImpression: Sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Cardiac murmur.\n\u2022 PVCs.\n\u2022 Hypertension.\n\u2022 Hyperlipidemia.\n\u2022 Hypothyroid.\n\u2022 Lightheadedness/dizziness.\n\nPLAN\n\nCardiac murmur\nDiana has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the RUSB with mild radiation to the carotids. This is most likely representative of aortic stenosis. She does have symptoms including a significant increase in fatigue over the last 6 months, shortness of breath, and some lightheadedness. This could be due to severe aortic stenosis, however, her S2 is relatively preserved which would be more consistent with moderate. She is unsure if she has had an echocardiogram, although some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction, so it is possible that she had one as some point in the past. We will order a repeat echocardiogram today to assess overall cardiac structure and function as well as valvular disease. If she does truly have severe aortic stenosis, I briefly discussed a TAVR procedure today as she is not a candidate for a surgical AVR given her age co-morbidities and frailty. She is unsure if she would be interested in this, but we will assess first with the echocardiogram and then discuss further at follow-up. She does not appear significantly volume overloaded today.\n\nPVCs\nHer referral mentions tachycardia. Her EKG today shows sinus rhythm with frequent PVCs as well as anterior septal infarct pattern. She does not have any significant palpitations. We will check an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function. Depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis, we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or possibly a heart monitor to assess the overall burden of PVCs. At this point, she is asymptomatic, so we will start with the echocardiogram only.\n\nHypertension\nShe is taking amlodipine and lisinopril. We will continue these as is.\n\nHyperlipidemia\nThis is managed by her PCP. She is on simvastatin 20 mg. She is having bilateral leg pain over the past month. This could be related to the simvastatin possibly and given her age, it would not be unreasonable to stop the simvastatin, but I will defer to her PCP. She has no known CAD but if we were to do a TAVR evaluation and this was discovered, a statin would be indicated.\n\nHypothyroidism\nShe takes levothyroxine for supplementation and will continue this as is.\n\nLightheadedness/dizziness\nShe is on meclizine for this. It is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness are related to the aortic stenosis, and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above. She is also having some PVCs on her EKG, which could be contributing, but she does not feel palpitations. We will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nFollow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps.\n",

The onset of his symptoms began 2 years ago. He has noticed that his breathing is not what it used to be. He describes an increased need to catch his breath. The patient also reports he gets \u201cmid-shortness of breath\u201d without reason. He has been seen at an urgent care where he received a nebulizer treatment and was prescribed an inhaler, which he uses when his symptoms are present.

He will continue to use the albuterol inhaler; however, he should limit its use to when he is experiencing a severe flare-up of symptoms. I advised he should take it as soon as he starts to feel any symptoms at all. I have also prescribed the patient Singulair 10 mg to be taken once daily. This should help to decrease the occurrences of his asthma. I have also recommended we proceed with an allergy skin test to target what his triggers are in the hope that we can avoid any other management.

      "reference": "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nWayne Jenkins is a pleasant 43-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right foot wound, onset 2 to 3 weeks ago. He was seen by his primary care physician who referred him to our office. His last visit with a podiatrist was 2 years ago, however they moved, and he has been unable to get another podiatrist. He denies any specific injury.\n\nThe patient purchased a new pair of shoes and was breaking them in prior to traveling. Initially, he did not feel that the shoes were too tight, however a blister formed on his right foot. The patient does have neuropathy and notes this might be why he did not notice the tightness. His blister soon became a wound and he was seen by his PCP. He was placed on a round of antibiotics, which he completed yesterday. He denies any changes to the appearance of the wound. The patient denies pain or drainage. His sock will occasionally stick to his wound, regardless of if he has a Band-Aid covering it. The patient has discontinued the use of these shoes. Occasionally, he has issues with stability, which was a primary purpose of purchasing these shoes. He denies any fever or chills.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, his last hemoglobin A1C was 8.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fever and chills.\nSkin: Reports right foot wound.\nNeurological: Reports neuropathy.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature: 98.1.\nHeart rate: 72.\nRespiration: 16.\nBlood pressure: 110/65 mm Hg.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses. No palpable DP or PT pulses but Doppler signs are present. No evidence of fluid collection.\nSKIN: On the right foot, there is a 1 x 2 inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot that is just proximal to the 5th MTP joint. There is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue. No surrounding erythema or cellulitis. No necrosis. No odor.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Right foot diabetic ulcer.\n2. Diabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient regarding his current symptoms. I have explained to him that his x-rays did not reveal any evidence of osteomyelitis. At this time, I have recommended that we obtain an ankle brachial index ABI to determine the blood supply to his foot to see if he can heal this wound. I have also performed a debridement in the office to remove some of the dead tissue. I have prescribed a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound 1 time daily and instructed him to cover with a dry sterile dressing. He will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and the nice pink tissue is present. I have also recommended that the patient be placed in a surgical shoe to take pressure off the area. I do not think that antibiotics are needed at this time. He may need to see a vascular specialist if the ABI indicates that his blood supply is not optimal for wound healing.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, I explained the need for controlling his diabetes and the effects this will have on wound healing. I have recommended a diabetic consultation to discuss diet modifications to bring his hemoglobin A1c to a better level.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks to check on his progress.",

He has a past medical history significant for hypertension and type 2 diabetes.\n\nApproximately 1 week ago, the patient sustained an injury to his right knee while at a trampoline park. He explains that he was jumping on a trampoline when he heard a snap, followed by instant pain in the lateral aspect of his knee. This is not a common activity for him, and he admits that he is inconsistent with exercise. As far as treatment, he has been elevating his knee and taking Tylenol without significant relief of his pain. He has not tried applying heat or ice to the area.\n\nIn terms of his hypertension, the patient admits that he did not purchase a blood pressure cuff as previously recommended. While he does not monitor his blood pressures at home, he has been compliant with lisinopril 20 mg.\n\nHis diabetes appears to be stable based on home monitoring, although he is only checking his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week. He does not follow any specific diet plan, but he does try to make healthier choices such as limiting his carbohydrate intake. He has also been taking his metformin 500 mg as prescribed.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure: 180/80 mmHg\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm.

Diabetes type 2.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, his symptoms appear to be consistent with a lateral ligament strain of the right knee. I am going to prescribe meloxicam 15 mg once daily for pain and swelling. I also put in a referral for physical therapy so he can work on strengthening the muscles around the area and prevent any further injury. We can consider further imaging if he continues to have pain, but I explained that this is a common injury that typically heals on it's own.\n\nFor his hypertension, I'm concerned that his blood pressure is not well controlled at this time, so we may need to modify his medication. I'm going to order an echocardiogram for further evaluation, but I want him to continue taking his lisinopril 20 mg for now.\n\nFor his diabetes, he stated that he has been measuring his blood glucose levels 4 to 5 times per week, but I want him to start measuring them 2 to 3 times per day. His hemoglobin A1c levels should provide more detail as far as his long-term progress so we will order that today. I'm also going to order a lipid panel and we can determine if any adjustments need to be made to his medication. In the meantime, he should continue taking metformin 500 mg.\n",

The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 30 years ago, when he fell off of a roof. He endorses that it was very bothersome and he was unable to play football. He states that he was told that he may have a fracture at that time. The patient reports that his pain has worsened 1 month ago. He locates his pain to his lower back, which radiates into his left hip, down his left leg, on the side of his calf, and into his left big toe. The patient describes his pain as an \"electrical tooth ache\" that radiates down his entire left leg. He notes that he has to use a cane to walk as his left foot drags when he walks. He rates his pain level as a 6 to 8 out of 10, however it can get to a 13 out of 10 at its worst. He states that he did not take any medication before his appointment so it did not affect his pain during our visit. The patient notes that he was in the waiting room for 30 minutes today and states that it made his symptoms worse. His pain is aggravated by standing, ambulating, coughing, and sneezing. The patient states that he is unable to tie his shoes secondary to the pain. The patient states that his pain is alleviated by lying down. He also reports weakness in his bilateral legs and his back.

Initially, her headaches appeared during menses, however she now experiences them more frequently and with more severity. Her pain is aggravated by physical activities. The patient states that she has been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight, however she is unable to exercise for prolonged periods of time secondary to the headaches. The patient locates her pain to the right side of her head and behind her eye. She describes her pain as a pulsing sensation. She also reports intermittent ringing in her ears for the last few months. Additionally, she reports intermittent blurred vision on the lateral aspect of her vision.

It appears the nodule is smooth in appearance. No evidence of any type of emphysematous disease is present.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n\n1. Right upper lobe lung nodule.\n- Medical Reasoning: The patient has incidentally found right upper lobe lung nodule visible on his chest CT. It could be a benign nodule, but because of his smoking history, I think it is best that he has it surgically removed.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I had a thorough discussion with the patient concerning surgical treatment. Surgery will require general anesthesia and will take approximately 1.5 hours. I explained to the patient that his procedure will consist of 3 small incisions being made on the side of his right chest. I will then insert a camera and scope to assist in removing the nodule along with a very small portion of his lung. He was advised that he will be admitted for most likely an overnight stay. He will have a chest tube in until the following day when I remove it at his bedside. All questions were answered.\n- Medical Treatment: Pulmonary function test ordered today to obtain patient's baseline. PET CT will also be scheduled to determine if the nodule is metabolically active, which can suggest if it is cancerous or inflammatory. Nodule will be removed via video assisted thoracoscopy.\n\n2. Rheumatoid arthritis.\n- Medical Reasoning: Stable.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: I encouraged the patient to continue to follow up with his rheumatologist.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue medication therapy and routine follow up with rheumatologist as previously outlined.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n",

      "reference": "SUBJECTIVE\n\nDifficulty swallowing. Tyler Green is a 56-year-old male who presents today complaining of difficulty swallowing.\n\nThe patient noticed the difficulty swallowing approximately 4 to 5 weeks ago. He describes it as something stuck in his throat. He states that it bothers him a little bit throughout the day as sometimes it becomes painful. The patient states that occasionally when he tries to eat something relatively solid it seems to get stuck and he will have to wash it down with a drink. He states that he has never fully choked before, but has recently thought about potentially choking. He denies having to cough. Denies having this issue with liquids, hot or cold. Denies hematochezia, vomiting blood, coughing up blood, any weight changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, the patient states he is doing well. He states that he checks his blood sugars most of the time, but sometimes he is in a hurry and will forget. However, he does note that when he checks his blood sugar, they are within range. He is compliant with his metformin 500 mg twice a day. He denies any side effects of the metformin such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. His last hemoglobin A1c was 7.4.\n\nIn regards to his blood pressure, the patient states that he is doing okay. He notes that occasionally he will have a lower blood pressure and then other days it will be elevated. However, he states they usually close in range. He is still taking Norvasc.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports a history of diabetes and hypertension.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports that he take metformin 500 mg twice a day and Norvasc.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies weight changes.\nHENT: Reports dysphagia.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, or hemoptysis.\nGastrointestinal: Denies hematochezia, hematemesis, vomiting, nausea, or diarrhea.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood pressure in office today is 120/50.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeck\n- General Examination: Neck is supple without thyromegaly or lymphadenopathy.

      "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight knee injury\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nMichelle King is a pleasant 44-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right knee injury. Her injury was sustained while skiing in Vermont last weekend after she caught her ski when coming off of the lift and fell. She reports a pop in her knee at the time of injury and has been experiencing pain since that time. Due to her fall she was unable to weight bear and had to be taken down by the ski patrol. She locates her pain to the lateral aspect of her knee and also describes the feeling of instability as well as buckling. At this time she is experiencing difficulty with knee flexion; however, she states this was not a problem immediately after the injury. Full knee extension is also quite painful for her. The patient denies any numbness or tingling in her toes. She is currently utilizing crutches for ambulation which were provided to her by the ski patrol. In terms of pain control, she is taking ibuprofen which is providing some relief.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports she is otherwise healthy and denies a history of high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports she is very active with skiing and taking care of her 4-year-old twins. She mentions that she would like to get back into running at some point. She states that her husband is home with her, but he also works a job where he has gone quite a bit.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports she is taking ibuprofen.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and limited range of motion.\nNeurological: Denies numbness or tingling in toes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGAIT: The patient is ambulating with crutches.\nCV: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmur.\nRESPIRATORY: Lungs are clear to auscultation.\nMSK: Examination of the right knee: Edema and effusion noted. Pain with palpation of the lateral knee. Decreased flexion and extension. Positive Lachman's. Palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse. No ankle edema.\n\nRESULTS\n\n4 views of the right knee were taken today. These reveal no bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight knee pain, possible ACL tear.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to her current symptoms. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the right knee to evaluate for a possible ACL tear. In the meantime, I have advised her to continue taking ibuprofen 600 to 800 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain. She will also be placed into a brace for increased knee support.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion.",

His pain began when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident in 02/2022 when he was on his way home from a pain clinic. The patient notes that he has been in 4 motor vehicle accidents; however, he notes that he was fine after the first two accidents, but the third motor vehicle accident is when his neck and back pain began. He states that he was in therapy following the second accident and had surgery after his third accident. The patient was seen at a pain clinic secondary to neck and back pain. He was prescribed fentanyl; however, he has not received a prescription for several weeks. Today, he reports that his pain is a 12 out of 10. He describes his pain as sharp and incapacitating with stiffness and pain. The patient also reports headaches, occasional dizziness. He denies any recent visual disturbances. He also reports numbness in his left arm and right leg. The patient also reports spasms throughout his body. He states that he has been experiencing fatigue since the accident.

      "prediction": "<reasoning>We need to produce a structured clinical note with sections: CHIEF COMPLAINT, HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, REVIEW OF SYSTEMS, PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. Must be concise but thorough. The conversation is messy, but we can extract key facts.\n\nChief complaint: Neck pain, possibly from multiple car crashes, currently severe. Also back pain, headaches, dizziness, numbness in left arm and right leg, spasms, fatigue.\n\nHistory: Multiple car crashes, last one February of current year (exact month). He had surgery after third crash. He had pain clinic, on fentanyl recently, but hasn't had prescription for weeks. Pain is sharp, incapacitating, rated \"12\" (though scale 1-10). Neck pain worsens with movement, especially flexion/extension. He has numbness left arm, right leg. Also headaches, occasional dizziness, fatigue. He has had therapy, pain clinic, possibly medication. He has bruising, swelling occasionally. No visible bruises today. He has had multiple crashes, but last one February. He had surgery after third crash. He had pain clinic, fentanyl. He is currently on no prescription.\n\nReview of systems: Neck pain, back pain, headaches, dizziness, numbness left arm, right leg, fatigue, possibly muscle spasms. No visual disturbances, no recent numbness elsewhere. He reports occasional bruising.\n\nPhysical exam: Pain on palpation of midline cervical spine and lateral muscles. Limited range of motion: side-to-side, flexion, extension painful. No bruising or swelling seen. No other exam findings mentioned.\n\nAssessment: Neck sprain (cervical strain) likely from recent car crash. No fracture on imaging. Consider cervical radiculopathy? Numbness left arm, right leg suggests possible central involvement? But likely musculoskeletal. Plan: Order MRI of cervical spine. Conservative treatment: Ice, gentle exercises, start Robaxin 1500 mg q6-8h (though 1500 mg seems high; maybe 1500 mg total? but we will note). Consider pain med referral if inadequate.
