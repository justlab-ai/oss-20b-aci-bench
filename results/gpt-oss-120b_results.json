The patient is seen in consultation at the request of Dr. Henry Howard for possible surgical intervention.\n\nThe patient presented to his primary care provider, Dr. Howard, on 03/01/2021 complaining of worsening headaches over the past few months. He denied any trouble with headaches in the past. Further work up of headaches with MRI of the brain revealed the pituitary lesion.\n\nMr. Ward reports headaches started about 3 months ago, at which point they were around 3 out of 10 in severity. They have gradually worsened over time and now he rates them at about 6/10. The headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feel like a dull ache behind the eyes. They tend to last a few hours at a time, and nothing makes them particularly worse or better. Tylenol failed to improve headaches.\n\nThe patient endorses that recently he has been bumping into door frames, but no obvious problems with his balance or vision. He denies any recent sickness or feeling sick and negative for fever, rash, paresthesia, weakness, neck stiffness, or syncope.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nNewly diagnosed pituitary lesion.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNo known family history; adopted.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nEmployment Status: Works as a computer programmer.\nMarital Status: Married for 25 years.\nLiving Arrangement: Lives with wife, recently purchased a new house.\nAlcohol Use: None.\nTobacco Use: Non-smoker.\nRecreational Drugs: None.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nNeurological\nPatient alert, oriented to person, place, and time, affect appropriate and speech fluent. Cranial nerve examination grossly intact. No focal motor or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities.\n\nEyes\nVisual acuity and eye movements are normal. Pupils are equal and reactive. Visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia. Color vision is normal.\n\nRESULTS\n\nLabs reviewed, 03/03/2021: CBC, U&Es, coagulation, and CRP are all normal. Pituitary hormone profile demonstrates a low TSH, all other results were normal.\n\nIndependent review and interpretation of MRI brain, 03/04/2021: The MRI reveals a pituitary lesion with elevation and compression of the optic chiasm. The ventricles are normal in size and no other abnormalities are noted.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n\u2022 Pituitary adenoma\n\u2022 Bitemporal hemianopia\n\nMr. Ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has a benign appearing pituitary adenoma discovered on work up for worsening headaches. There is clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression, examination today revealed a bitemporal hemianopia. Radiographically this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma but that there was no way to be sure without a pathological diagnosis. Surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated given optic chiasmal compression.\n\nPLAN\n\nPituitary adenoma.\nWe discussed the general indications for surgical intervention. The risks, benefits to trans-sphenoidal resection were explained to the patient. The risks of anesthesia including but not limited to the risks of heart attack, stroke, and death. The risks of surgery including infection, need for further surgery, wound issues (such as spinal fluid leak or infection) which may require prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure, seizure, stroke, permanent numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or death.

      "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nEsophagitis.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nBetty Hill is a 53 y.o. female who presents to clinic today for a new patient evaluation of suspected esophagitis. The patient was referred from the emergency department where she was seen in early 10/2020 following 4 days of chest pain. The pain has resolved but she kept this appointment to discuss the original 4-day episode.\n\nThe patient describes her chest pain in early 10/2020 as sharp and localized behind the sternum. She states that it felt like a heart attack and the onset was sudden. The pain was exacerbated by eating and accompanied by dysphagia. The patient is not able to say whether she had heartburn as she has never experienced heartburn before and is unsure what it feels like. When asked about potential triggers, the patient identifies that she was experiencing a lot of stress at that time due to a job transition. She was able to tolerate the chest pain and dysphagia for 4 days but reports that nothing she tried relieved her symptoms. She then presented to the emergency department and underwent labs and EKG. All results came back normal from these tests. She was not prescribed any medications in the emergency department but was given a referral to me for suspected esophagitis. Her chest pain and dysphagia resolved spontaneously approximately 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred.\n\nThe patient denies unintentional weight loss, weight gain, abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea. She states she is trying to lose weight.\n\nPAST HISTORY\n\nMedical\nUterine fibroids.\nAnemia.\n\nSurgical\nCholecystectomy.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY\n\nNone reported.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\n\u2022\u202fCardiovascular:\u202f Positive for chest pain.\n\u2022\u202fGastrointestinal:\u202f Positive for difficulty swallowing.\n\u2022\u202fPsychiatric:\u202f Positive for stress.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nGastrointestinal\nMild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe patient\u2019s emergency department records from her 10/2020 visit were reviewed, including the normal cardiac workup.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nThe patient presents today following a visit to the emergency department in early 10/2020 for 4-days of sharp chest pain, made worse by eating, and dysphagia. Notably, the patient was experiencing higher levels of stress than normal for her at that time due to a job transition. Her cardiac evaluation in the emergency department was normal and she was referred to me for suspected esophagitis. The patient\u2019s pain and associated dysphagia spontaneously resolved 3 days after her emergency department visit and has not recurred. Possible etiologies of her chest pain and dysphagia include GERD, dyspepsia, esophagitis, musculoskeletal etiologies, and anxiety. Based on her history today, I suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition, plus or minus a contribution from musculoskeletal etiologies.\n\nNon-cardiac chest pain.\n\nSuspected etiology of anxiety with or without underlying musculoskeletal etiology.\n\nPLAN\n\n\u2022 We discussed the role of an EGD in evaluating her prior symptoms. Given her current asymptomatic status, I am comfortable foregoing the EGD for now in lieu of continued monitoring for symptom recurrence. The patient agreed to notify my office if her symptoms return at which time, we could schedule the EGD.

She was referred to nephrology by genetics who recommended renal screening tests. At birth, the patient weighed 4 pounds 8 ounces, exhibited difficulties during eating where she would stop breathing, and challenges regulating her body temperature; determined to be typical issues associated with premature birth. The patient has seen many specialists, including GI for severe reflux, a dietitian who recommended discontinuing consumption of cow\u2019s milk, and a neurologist who diagnosed her with Smith-Magenis syndrome. Additionally, she has been seen by a geneticist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, and audiologist. The patient is not ambulatory, did not sit up unassisted until 1 years old, and is currently crawling and attempting to take steps. She will be starting speech therapy in the next few weeks, and currently she is in occupational, feeding, and physical therapy. The geneticist informed the patient's mother that patients with Smith-Magenis syndrome usually have kidney issues where \u201cthe kidneys fuse into one\u201d and issues with their legs.\n\nThe patient has approximately 8 to 10 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Her mother notes that she is doing better with drinking fluids and she urinates \u201ca lot\u201d. The patient drinks Ripple Pea Protein milk instead of cow\u2019s milk, water and water mixed with a small amount of juice. Her twin sister is approximately the same size, and their weight is essentially the same, she is healthy, and the mom denies any known health concerns or diagnoses.

      "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight wrist injury.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nDiana Scott is a pleasant 61-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a right wrist injury. The patient sustained this injury yesterday morning, 05/12/2022, when she slipped on the stairs while carrying a laundry basket. She states she tried to catch herself with her arms outstretched. The patient reports an immediate onset of pain and swelling in her right wrist. She denies any previous injuries to her right arm. The patient rates her pain level as a 9/10. Her pain is aggravated by movement. The patient also reports numbness and tingling in her fingers. She has been icing and wrapping her right wrist with an ACE wrap. The patient has also been taking ibuprofen, which provides some relief. She notes fully extending her arm while resting it on a pillow alleviates some of her pain as well.\n\nThe patient is going on vacation in 1 month.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right wrist pain and swelling.\nNeurological: Reports numbness and tingling to the digits of the right hand.\n\nVITALS\n\nBlood Pressure: Elevated at 140/70 mmHg.\nHeart Rate: 80 beats per minute.\nRespiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute.\nBody Temperature: 97.2 degrees F.\nHEAD: Normocephalic\nNECK: No swelling noted\nCV: No bilateral lower extremity edema. No carotid bruit. No murmurs, gallops or rubs heard during auscultation of the heart. Palpabale pulses to the bilateral lower extremities.\nRESPIRATORY: Normal respiratory effort no respiratory distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nGI/GU: Non-distended\nBACK: No evidence of trauma or deformity\nNECK: No adenopathy. No thyromegaly.\nMSK: Examination of the right wrist: Limited range of movement. Tenderness to palpation. Pain on flexion and extension. Pain with radial deviation and lateral deviation. Pain with wrist abduction and adduction. The metacarpals are intact. Obvious swelling and bruising. Tenderness on palpation throughout. There is evidence of potential fracture feeling and bony crepitus.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the right wrist were taken today. These reveal the fracture appears extra-articular and proximal to the radioulnar joint. Dorsal angulation of the distal fracture fragment is present to a variable degree. Dorsal angulation is severe, presenting with a dinner fork deformity. An ulnar styloid fracture is present.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight wrist Colles fracture.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have discussed with the patient that her x-rays revealed a right wrist Colles fracture. We discussed treatment options and I have recommended that we proceed with a right wrist ORIF and all indicated procedures. We reviewed the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the surgery. I explained that we should schedule the operation for as soon as possible to ensure adequate healing and to limit malformation of the wrist. I advised that this procedure will require her to be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay.\n\nIn the meantime, the patient will be placed in a thumb spica brace and receive instructions on its proper usage. I have prescribed the patient Ultram 50 mg every 6 hours to treat her pain. We also discussed that her postoperative course will include wearing a brace for 6 weeks. A few weeks after surgery, the patient will initiate formal physical therapy and will attend 3 times per week to strengthen her right wrist. The patient has a 2-week vacation planned in 1 month. I recommended that we consult with her physical therapist to determine if there are exercises she can perform on her own instead of postponing her vacation.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 4 weeks status post surgery to discuss her progress.\n",

Her pain is localized deep in her patella and occurs less than once daily. Due to the fleeting nature of these episodes, she has not taken medication and simply braces herself until it passes. She denies any trauma or injury, or ever hearing or feeling a pop in the knee. Her symptoms do not interfere with her daily activities and she does not use a cane.\n\nRegarding her hypertension, it has been several days since she last checked her blood pressure at home, but it was approximately 120/70 mmHg at that time. Her current medications include amlodipine, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide, all of which she takes on a regular basis.\n\nIn terms of her diabetes, her fasting morning blood glucose levels have been approximately 130 based on home monitoring.

      "reference": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nNon-healing ulcer on his right foot.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nNicholas Gutierrez is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of a non-healing ulcer on his right foot. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 6 weeks ago, after wearing a pair of shoes that were too tight.\n\nToday, he describes a burning, stinging, and throbbing sensation. The patient reports a blister on the pad of the plantar aspect of his foot around his heel. He explains that he has been ambulating on the anterior aspect of his foot. He explains that the top part of the skin of the blister detached, which revealed a thick, soft, mushy skin associated with unpleasant smell and yellow drainage. The patient called his primary care physician, who referred him to our office. He was prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics approximately 6 days ago. He experienced chills and a fever of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The patient denies any nausea or vomiting. He states that when he started the antibiotics, his foot began to feel pretty good. However, he has now noticed that his foot has turned black around the outside of the wound, and he is experiencing cramping in his calf muscle as well. He also reports a burning red streak that was coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle. While palpating his calf, he has noted stiffness in the muscle that is now up to the patella. The patient reports that he has been coughing a lot over the last 2 days. He has experienced shortness of breath with ambulation around the house. He reports that he purchases new diabetic shoes yearly and changes the inserts every 3 to 4 months.\n\nThe patient is diabetic and has diabetic neuropathy. He explains that his blood sugar has been trending in the 300 to 400's over the last 2 weeks. At one point, he had a blood sugar spike to either 500 or 600. He states that his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.7, which has been his average for approximately 2 years. The patient checks his blood sugar 2 to 3 times per day and rarely has a blood sugar that goes over 200. He explains that he used to be on an insulin pump and had an A1c that at one point was 13. He states that he worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it is now.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient reports a history of diabetic neuropathy.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient enjoys hiking.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Reports subjective fever and chills\nRespiratory: Reports cough and shortness of breath with ambulation.\nGastrointestinal: Denies nausea and vomiting.\nMusculoskeletal: Reports right foot pain and right calf cramping.\nSkin: Reports right foot ulcer with yellow foul smelling drainage, and red streaking coming up the front part of his ankle along the inside portion of his calf muscle.\n\nVITALS\n\nTemperature is slightly elevated.\nVitals are otherwise good.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Edema and pain in calf. Bilateral palpable femoral and papiteal pulses are present. I do not recognize a palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse; however, they are present via Doppler.\nMSK: Examination of the right foot: The necrotic wound on his heel is present. It is approximately 2 cm x 2 cm. I do recognize the sloughing of the tissue, as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area, and erythema. An odor is present from the wound. I do not appreciate any bony exposure now. No pain to palpation in the effected area.\n\nRESULTS\n\n3 views of the right foot were taken today. These reveal no evidence of osteomyelitis or infection.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nRight non-healing diabetic foot ulcer.\nDiabetes.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regard to his current symptoms. I have explained to him that I do not see any evidence of osteomyelitis. I am concerned about the redness that is moving up his leg, as well as the swelling, and pain that he has in his calf. I have recommended that we obtain a venous ultrasound to check his blood supply for the wound. I have also recommended that we perform a debridement of the wound today. We may have to obtain a culture and look at different antibiotic therapy. I am recommending that he continue with antibiotics that his primary care physician prescribed.\n\nIn regard to his diabetes, I have advised him to follow up with his endocrinologist to ensure that we do continue to keep his hemoglobin A1c below 7. We will need to closely monitor his blood sugar since we are going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and potentially some other medications depending on the culture results.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me in 7 days to check on his progress.",

Tick bite.\n- Medical Reasoning: My concern is that he might have Lyme disease based on the presentation of his right knee.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed blood testing to determine if he does in fact have Lyme disease. I explained that Lyme disease can cause problems with other organs if not treated appropriately. We discussed that sometimes antibiotics need to be administered intravenously if oral antibiotics are not given early enough. We will see how he does with a course of oral antibiotics as I would like to avoid intravenous antibiotics.\n- Medical Treatment: Prescription for doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 weeks provided. Lyme titer and Western blot will be obtained to determine if he has Lyme disease.\n\n2. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: This is well-controlled at this time.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: The patient and I discussed that he is doing really well monitoring his blood pressure at home.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue lisinopril 20 mg once a day. Lipid panel ordered to assess his cholesterol levels.\n\n3. Diabetes type 2.\n- Medical Reasoning: He is doing a good job managing his diabetes since his blood sugars are running in the 120s. I do not think we need to make any adjustments, but we will see what the hemoglobin A1c shows as that gives us an idea of what his blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed that metformin can affect kidney function; however, his kidney function was last checked 2 months ago, and it has remained within normal limits.\n- Medical Treatment: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice a day. Hemoglobin A1c ordered. Basic metabolic panel ordered to assess kidney function. \n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.",
